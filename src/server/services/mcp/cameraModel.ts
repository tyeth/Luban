// The camera model: where the camera is, what it sees, and whether any of
// that can still be believed.
//
// Operator law (2026-09-19): the camera is NOT a rig constant. It can sit
// differently after every power cycle, be knocked, be re-aimed, or be a
// different camera entirely. So camera geometry is SESSION STATE, and nothing
// may turn a pixel into a machine coordinate - or a machine coordinate into a
// viewing pose - until a model has been solved and verified in this power
// cycle.
//
// What this replaces: a 2x2 pixel->mm matrix keyed by machine Y
// (calibration.ts), with no pose, no perspective, no field of view and no
// validity state. It could not answer "where must the toolhead go to see
// this?", which is the question that cost the 2026-09-19 session three
// approvals of trial and error, an assumed offset of "90-150 mm toward -X"
// taken from a skill, and a sign that turned out to be the other way.
//
// Pure: no server imports, unit-tested in tests/cameraModel.test.ts.
