 * A probe feed transport delivers raw sensor values per channel; the
 * ProbeFeedService owns everything downstream (polarity, the reading cache,
 * the overtravel/crash latch, reconnection). Implementations extend
 * EventEmitter and emit:
 *
 *   'reading' (channel: ProbeChannel, value: string, meta?: ReadingMeta) - the sensor CHANGED
 *             (meta.sentAt: the transport's own wall-clock ms at detection, when it has one,
 *             so the server can measure pipe latency)
 *   'refresh' (channel: ProbeChannel, value: string) - polled, unchanged
 *             (freshness only; MQTT never emits it, polling GPIO does)
 *   'error'   (err: Error)  - after connect() resolved; connect failures reject
 *   'close'   ()            - the transport is dead; the service reconnects
 *
 * A closed transport is not reusable - the service builds a new one from
 * freshly resolved configuration on every (re)connect.
