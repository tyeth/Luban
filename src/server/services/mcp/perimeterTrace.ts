// The unknown-pocket PERIMETER TRACER (operator spec, 2026-09-22 01:25 BST):
// "a survey of the corners and all the internal walls of the pocket, ideally
// just doing 0.1 millimeter bumping in the corners (or where non-straight
// paths / deviations are detected) so there's no retreat wastage, except
// when it encounters an inability to step forwards, in which case it should
// change the approach angle and try 0.1 mm in that direction after
// retreating back the 0.1 mm it had attempted when making unexpected
// contact."
//
// The crawl, in TIP-CENTRE space, with the probe EXPECTED on every move:
//   0. (runner) law 2 to the start, a point KNOWN to be inside the pocket;
//      march `dir` to the first wall; back off bump_mm along the normal.
//   1. Step fine_step along the tangent (the normal turned so the wall stays
//      on the chosen side, default the RIGHT - right hand on the wall walks
//      an internal perimeter counter-clockwise).
//   2. Tangent step CONTACTS -> retreat exactly the attempted step along its
//      reverse, turn the tangent AWAY from the wall by turn_step, try again
//      (internal corners and inward curves at fine resolution). A full 360
//      of failed turns aborts.
//   3. Tangent step is FREE -> bump toward the wall along the inward normal
//      in fine steps until contact (cap bump_cap_steps); the contact is a
//      perimeter point and the head backs off the one step that touched. If
//      the wall has fallen away past the cap, turn the tangent TOWARD the
//      wall by turn_step (outward curves, external corners).
//   4. Straightness: a running total-least-squares line over the last
//      straight_points contacts; while its max residual is under
//      line_tolerance the tangent step is coarse_step; back to fine_step the
//      moment a step contacts, a bump needs more than one step or the
//      residual grows.
//   5. Closure: heading turned 360 and the tip centre within one coarse step
//      of the first wall point. Otherwise the crawl STOPS (partial polyline,
//      clear ending) on the perimeter budget, max_steps, the bounds or a
//      keep-out.
//   Confirm cycles (lift-and-retest, the expensive part) only where they buy
//   accuracy (operator addendum): the FIRST wall contact, the contact after
//   a MAJOR direction change, any UNEXPECTED contact, and optional accuracy
//   points EVERY accuracy_every_mm. A routine bump is one sensed contact.
//
// Pure: no server imports. The runner (probeTracePerimeter.ts) binds the IO
// to the engine; tests run it on a synthetic pocket (tests/perimeterTrace.test.ts).
