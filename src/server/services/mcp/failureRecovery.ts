// Modal cleanup after a FAILED tool call (#221).
//
// Why this exists: a failed operation can stop after selecting `G53` (machine
// workspace) or `G91` (relative distance) and before handing the controller
// back its normal `G90`/`G54`. Luban then refuses ordinary jogging, the
// position of record goes incoherent, and - worse - an agent may read a later
// command's coordinate or distance mode wrongly. Every tool call goes through
// ToolRegistry.call(), so that is where the hook runs, still inside the call's
// ownership gate: it reads a per-call "modal ledger" of what was actually sent
// and decides, with stated reasons, whether a no-motion restore is warranted
// and permitted.
//
// What it never does: retry the failed command, send an axis word, turn the
// failure into a success, set or clear the position of record, or talk to a
// connection generation the operation did not start on.
//
// Pure apart from node's async_hooks: no Luban server imports. The runtime
// pieces (send, connection, position) are injected, and unit-tested with fakes
// in tests/failureRecovery.test.ts.
