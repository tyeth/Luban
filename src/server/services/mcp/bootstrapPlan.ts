// Planning the camera pre-configuration stage: which poses, in which order,
// at which heights, and which of them the machine may not actually reach.
//
// The shape of the procedure comes straight from law 2 and law 4:
//
//   - every XY move happens at or above the motion floor, so the plan is a
//     sequence of (traverse, descend, capture..., raise) and never moves in
//     XY and Z together;
//   - the Z sweep happens with XY STATIONARY, which is what makes it a
//     parallax baseline rather than a diagonal through unknown space;
//   - the camera looks into keep-out boxes on purpose - that is where the
//     targets are - but the TOOLHEAD must stay out of them, so every planned
//     pose is checked at the toolhead and a pose that cannot be reached is
//     dropped or restricted WITH A REASON, never quietly adjusted.
//
// Pure: no server imports, unit-tested in tests/bootstrapPlan.test.ts.
