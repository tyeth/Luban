// Continuous X/Y/Z hold for the USB pendant (LUBAN_PENDANT_PIPELINE=1): the
// pure parts. One G53 at D1 press, clock-paced G1 increments while the stick is
// held, one G54 at release or at any stop. Z words are sent only after an
// in-hold M114 has proved the hold's chain (zBaselineProblem). No server
// imports, so every piece here is unit-tested without a machine
// (tests/pendantHold.test.ts).
//
// Why there are no "runs" any more (operator, hardware, 2026-10-05): the
// earlier pipeline queued about a second of G1 segments up front, closed the
// run with a G54 that drained the planner (~550 ms), then waited up to 2 s for
// a verified beat before the next run. The result was a second of motion, a
// 0.5-2 s stop, repeat, and ~0.5 s of queued motion after D1 was released. The
// run concept itself was the cause, so it is gone: the hold is one G53 window
// paced by the clock, and the only G54 is the one that closes it.
//
// Hardware facts this module is built on (measured by the operator): G53 does
// not wait for motion; a G1 is acknowledged in 38-69 ms while the move itself
// takes ~175 ms (the controller replies once the move is queued); the status
// report carries the planner's queued position, not the stepper position;
// `M503 S` and `M220 S100` work over HTTP.
