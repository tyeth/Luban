// What a probe feed's silence MEANS, in words an operator or an agent can act

//
// Live 2026-09-19: the KB2040 U2IF bridge enumerated on USB, `import board`
// resolved its board id, and the first `digitalio.DigitalInOut(...)` never
// returned - the bridge was wedged. The transport reported "GPIO monitor
// produced no ready line within 30000 ms" and retried quietly for eighteen
// minutes. That sentence is equally true of a missing interpreter, an
// uninstalled Blinka and a hung bridge, and only one of those is fixed by
// replugging a board. Nothing else said anything at all: the machine was not
// connected, so the Workspace pills were not on screen, and the status was a
// `connected: false` among forty other fields.
//
// Probing itself was never unsafe - assertChannelReady refuses without a live
// feed - but "you find out when you try to probe" is not good enough for a
// sensor whose whole job is to be watching.
//
// Pure: no server imports, unit-tested in tests/probeFeedHealth.test.ts.
