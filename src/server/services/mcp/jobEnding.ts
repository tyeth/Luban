/**
 * What stopping a job should actually DO, given its kind and state.
 *
 * Before this, only an un-started PROCEDURE was withdrawn; a staged `file` or
 * `direct` job fell through to the firmware stop, which stops nothing when
 * nothing is running - so the job kept its `approved` state and its confirm
 * link, and an operator could still start it later. Live 2026-09-19 the agent
 * had to tell its operator in prose "do not approve job 245869890315".
 *
 *  - 'already-ended': terminal, nothing to do.
 *  - 'withdraw': never handed to the machine, so mark it stopped here. The
 *    confirm page answers 409 for any non-`awaiting_confirmation` state, so
 *    this genuinely kills the link.
 *  - 'request-procedure-stop': a running server-driven runner stops at its
 *    next step boundary and raises.
 *  - 'machine-stop': a file/direct job already handed over - firmware stop.
