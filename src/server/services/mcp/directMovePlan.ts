/**
 * Plans and gates for the two direct XY tools, ruled on by the operator on
 * 2026-09-21 ("goto work origin is a risk, but move_and_capture should be z
 * gated first, and home is safe"):
 *
 * - gateDirectXy: the Z precondition of `move_and_capture`, decided BEFORE
 *   any XY is commanded, from the position of record. Until that day the
 *   check compared against the motion floor and was skipped outright when
 *   machine Z was unknown.
 * - planGotoWorkOrigin: `goto_work_origin` as a STAGED job. Work (0, 0) is
 *   resolved through the heartbeat's origin offset, planned like a traverse
 *   (floor, travel, landmarks) and emitted in MACHINE coordinates, so the
 *   confirm page shows where the head will actually go - a work origin is
 *   operator-set and dies on a machine reboot, so "work zero" can be anywhere
 *   on the bed.
 *
 * Pure: no server imports (unit-tested under ts-node).
