// Position of record: what the sensor-gated motion engine KNOWS about where
// the machine is, independent of the heartbeat.
//
// Why this exists (hardware, 2026-09-05, job 1db4902a4cd6): a surface scan
// aborted at its station-4 position re-check after three clean stations. The
// two hop segments had each been echoed by the controller at their commanded
// positions, so the machine was exactly where the plan said - but the re-check
// judged the heartbeat instead:
//   - beat 1 still showed the segment-1 position (the status poll runs on its
//     own ~1 s cadence and lags a synchronous move by up to a period or two);
//   - beat 2 carried (170, 207.571, 227.7) in its x/y/z fields with the origin
//     offset still populated. Those are the MACHINE coordinates of the move
//     just completed: the HTTP channel sends `G90`, `G53;`, `G1 ...`, `G54;`
//     as four separate requests, and a status poll landing inside that window
//     reports the G53 frame. Subtracting the offset again produced
//     (221, 329.6, 555.7) and the scan aborted.
// The earlier fix (missing offsets reuse the last complete one) covered a
// different transient. This module covers both, plus the lag:
//   1. matchFrame() accepts a report in EITHER frame - work (the normal case)
//      or raw machine coordinates when the offset makes the two
//      distinguishable (the G53-window signature).
//   2. The engine records every verified arrival (controller echo or settled
//      heartbeat), and re-checks let that record outrank a heartbeat that
//      predates it. Any other gcode sent to the machine invalidates it.
//   3. Operator rule (2026-09-05): a move of <= 1 mm whose controller reply
//      carried no contradicting position may be taken as arrived when the
//      heartbeat is late, so inching is not paced by the status poll. Such a
//      position is recorded as `estimated`.
// Position judgements stay pure functions here so they can be unit-tested
// without a machine.
