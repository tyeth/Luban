// The stepped-traverse and link-descent algorithms of march.ts / probeCam.ts,
// written against a small IO interface so they run under ts-node against a
// fake machine (tests/marchCore.test.ts). march.ts binds them to the real
// engine (moveMachineSettled, senseAfter, the probe feed). No server imports.
//
// Why the split (issue #167, job f84f2a263333, 2026-09-21): a stepped link
// inside a pocket touched the wall, retreated +Z twice, climbed onto the rim
// and the guarded descent at the destination then met the top face - which
// the runner called a CRASH. None of that path had a test, because the
// traverse lived inside a module that imports the machine.
