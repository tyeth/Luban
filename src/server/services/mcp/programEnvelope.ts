// dialect would need a second parser, and a line an operator cannot tell from
// gcode IS gcode to them. The lines are honest: probing.moveMachineSettled
// sends each move as `G90 / G53; / G1 <words> F<feed>; / G54;`, so
// `G1 X190.000 Y140.000 F600` is the command, not a picture of it. What makes
