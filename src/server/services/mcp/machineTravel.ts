// Where the TOOLHEAD can actually go, as a planner may assume it.
//
// Nothing in the MCP knew this. `checkMotion` checks obstacles, and the
// position of record checks beats against the machine-definition size with a
// 50 mm slop - a sanity filter for garbage readings, deliberately loose, and
// never a statement about reachable travel. So a planner that wanted a band
// of XY to sweep had nothing to clamp against and invented its own slop:
// camera_bootstrap's search band used `max(-25, ...)` and `min(size.x + 40,
// ...)`, which on the A350 plans a first waypoint at X-25 when the travel
// stops at X-19 (live 2026-09-20). The procedure would have aborted on its
// first move, after an operator approval.
//
// The numbers vary per machine AND per rig: an A350's definition says
// 320 x 350, while its machine frame runs X -19...339 (home X-19, and X339
// found by sweep) and Y 0...342. A bracing kit, an Artisan, a re-homed
// firmware limit all move them again. So travel resolves in three layers,
// strongest first:
//
//   1. STATED - travel_x_min / travel_x_max / travel_y_min / travel_y_max in
//      the geometry store (set_probe_geometry, env-overridable). The
//      operator's measured limit for THIS rig.
//   2. OBSERVED - a position the machine has actually been at is proof that
//      point is reachable, so it widens an end nobody has stated. Home is the
//      usual source: an A350 sitting at X-19 has demonstrated X-19.
//   3. NOMINAL - the machine definition's size box, 0..size per axis.
//
// Evidence never overrides the operator: an observed position outside a
// STATED end is reported as a conflict rather than silently widening it,
// because one of the two is wrong and a planner should not pick.
//
// Pure: no server imports, unit-tested in tests/machineTravel.test.ts.
