// Exclusive gcode lease for a run that changes controller modal state across
// several requests (the USB pendant's queued G53 window). While it is held,
// every command from anyone else is refused at the channels (executeGcode and
// the SSTP job/override endpoints) and at the ConnectionManager entry points,
// so nothing can land between the run's G53 and its closing G54 and be read in
// the wrong frame. A UI "go to work origin" (G0 X0 Y0, G0 Z0) inside that
// window would be a machine-frame plunge, and a UI G54/G91/G92 would shift the
// run's next G1.
//
// The holder's own commands are recognised by async context (runAs), so no
// channel signature changes. The holder releases in `finally`.
//
// The RECOVERY HOLD is the frame-uncertainty latch (mcp/positionOfRecord.ts),
// read directly: there is no second state to fall out of step with it. While
// the latch is set, everyone is refused everything except no-motion frame
// recovery, homing, position queries, spindle off and job stop/pause, and no
// new lease is granted. The hold ends exactly when the latch clears - after an
// acknowledged restore AND a verified position (tools/machine.ts
// getPositionSnapshot) - whoever raised it: the pendant, the failed-call
// cleanup hook, or a Luban restart. `holdForRecovery` therefore re-raises the
// latch when none is set (2026-10-05 review: a hold that outlived its latch
// could never clear).
