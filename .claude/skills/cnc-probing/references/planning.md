# Planning related measurements without redundant approaches

Choose an existing procedure whose geometry and recovery rules fit the question. Local
continuation already exists; a full-height return in one runner does not imply it is missing
from the toolset. Keep all motion within the selected procedure's approved bounds and apply
`cnc-motion-rules` first.

## Capability and return boundaries

| Measurement | Existing tool | Movement between measurements |
|---|---|---|
| Top profile / height map | `probe_surface_path` / `probe_surface_grid` | Local lifts and guarded or stepped links; full approach to station 1 and raise at completion. Guarded uses `z_safe_delta_mm`; stepped uses `hop_lift_mm`. |
| Repeated contacts along a vertical wall | `probe_wall_follow` | Back off by `standoff_mm`, step along with contact handling away from the face, then march from the new position. A miss returns to the approved start line. |
| Unknown internal pocket, including polygonal or curved perimeter | `probe_trace_perimeter` / program `trace` | Release-verified standoff, local crawl, coarse steps on proven straights and selective confirmations. Requires a valid interior entry, measured depth, bounds and perimeter budget. External tracing is not exposed. |
| Internal corner between fitted walls | `probe_corner` | Bisector find followed by radial probes from the measured centre; retreats to that centre, not park, between probes. Requires fitted walls and a radius bound; not an external-corner tool. |
| Hole / boss diameter | `probe_circle` | Inside: radial probes from the staged interior position, returning there until final raise. Outside: full-height reposition between azimuths. Do not use the inside mode to avoid outside clearances. |
| Block top and sides | `probe_stock_outline` | Stepped top links; local standoff links on the same side; full raise/reposition when changing sides. Needs a suitable block estimate and valid approach geometry. |
| Planned mixed directions / CAM stations | `run_probing_gcode` | `link_mode: stepped` or `wall` enables local links and blocked-station handling. G38.2/G38.3 cycles still return to their own starts, including misses. Default `raise` uses full-height XY links. Read `cam-probing.md` for constraints. |
| Isolated axis/vector measurement | `probe_point` / `probe_vector` | Returns to the march start and raises on success. Vector probing supports polygon faces but does not itself follow the polygon. |
| Explicit independent approaches | `probe_sequence` | Every probe returns to its own start and raises, including `on_miss: continue`. One approval does not mean local continuation. |
| Multiple operations / B orientations / measured dependencies | `probe_program` | References feed earlier results into later bounded plans. Each successful probing op ends raised; groups and one approval do not fuse motion between ops. |

A same-column find → side probe → deeper search can cross these composition boundaries.
First ask whether a supported wall, surface, outline or CAM circuit expresses the intended
measurements safely. If not, record the exact transition that requires a return; do not invent
an endpoint-retention option or promise that batching will eliminate it. The shared internal
`marchToContact` primitive leaves retreat policy to its caller, but is not an agent-callable
motion tool. A miss does not make its entire surrounding region clear.

## Choose samples and an exit condition

- Define the missing boundary, height, width or uncertainty and the precision the cut needs.
  Measure enough to decide that question; do not automatically produce a dense contour.
- For a top transition, establish the applicable heights, bracket coarsely, then refine the
  unresolved interval. A verified high-side entry can make high-to-low scanning preferable
  to repeatedly climbing a shoulder; check body reach, fixtures and the entire link envelope.
- For walls and corners, use wall fits and residuals to select where more points are useful.
  For unknown internal perimeters, trace already adapts step size and confirmation placement;
  do not replace it with independent fully confirmed vector probes at every tiny increment.
- Preserve partial results and their X/Y/B, tool and setup context. A jaw approach or changed B
  may need a new high approach; a neighbouring contact or photograph alone does not clear it.
- Keep observation proportional: use the live viewer for progress, synchronized captures for
  specific contacts, and high-clearance views for rotary orientation/fixture context.

## Diagnose elapsed time before changing the plan

Use `runMs`, `byKind` and station timings from `result.timing` / `get_job_timing`. Separate:

1. initial unknown-height search;
2. return-to-park and repeated descent of already verified columns;
3. local lifts/links;
4. fine approaches, release checks and confirmations;
5. camera/rotation time and approval or conversation gaps.

`execMs` already contains motion plus controller/transport overhead. Sensor time is included
in `idleMs`; some idle can precede a run. Do not sum overlapping counters or substitute a
nominal feed calculation for elapsed job time. An unchanged 1 mm physical segment limit can
still require many controller transactions even when a logical coarse step is larger.

Choose the remedy that matches the dominant cost: fewer redundant stations, a suitable
continuous procedure, reuse of valid approach evidence, or bounded refinement near an edge.
Do not globally reduce confirmations or sensor delays, or assume every full retreat is waste.
An observed repeated transport cost is an optimization opportunity, not a proven saving until
an equivalent supported plan and its necessary clearances have been accounted for.
